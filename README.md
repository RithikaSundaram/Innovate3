## Project Details

### Overview
Greentrek is a web-based platform that helps individuals and businesses calculate their carbon footprint based on their daily activities. Users input relevant data such as transportation, energy consumption, and lifestyle choices to estimate their environmental impact. Based on their carbon footprint score, the platform provides personalized recommendations to adopt sustainable practices.

### Problem Statement
Climate change is accelerating due to excessive carbon emissions from human activities, yet many individuals and businesses lack awareness of their environmental impact. There is a gap in accessible, user-friendly tools that help people track, understand, and take action to reduce their carbon footprint.

### Solution
Greentrek provides an easy-to-use carbon footprint calculator that estimates emissions based on user input. The platform not only displays the carbon footprint but also offers actionable recommendations to help users make eco-friendly choices. Future integrations with APIs such as Google Maps (for transportation data) and Climatiq (for emission calculations) will further automate the process and improve accuracy.
